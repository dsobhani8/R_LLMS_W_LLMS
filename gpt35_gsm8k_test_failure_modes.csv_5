Index,Failure Mode,Description
1,Temporal Confusion,"Some questions ask the model to handle sequences of events or changes over time, requiring tracking of changes from step to step. For these, the model often struggles to correctly accumulate changes through each time period or step. For instance, in the question about the company's HR hiring 20 new employees every month, GPT-3.5 would have to recognize that the number of employees increases with each month and recalculate the total salary cost. This could lead to incorrect calculations if the model fails to track this element accurately."
2,Misinterpretation of Mathematical Operations,"There's a pattern of GPT-3.5 misunderstanding or misapplying mathematical operations in a number of questions. For instance, in the questions about the total number of goals scored in a match and the beanstalk's growth, the correct approach involves multiplication or addition, but the model may not correctly identify which operation is relevant."
3,Nested Conditionals,"In questions that involve multiple contingencies or conditional probabilities, such as the one where Marcus considers whether he needs to do his homework, the model needs to accurately handle each subsequent probability in the context of the previous ones. If GPT-3.5 doesn't accurately keep track of previous probabilities and their impacts on subsequent events or conditions, it may give an incorrect answer."
4,Relative References and Tracking,"Some questions involve keeping track of variables that change relative to each other or to a baseline number,, such as how a teacher's chalk usage changes day by day or how Erin's points change relative to Sara's. These types of questions may lead to incorrect answers if GPT-3.5 doesn't accurately track elements or interpret shifts in relative amounts."
5,Hierarchical Relationships and Implicit Comparisons,"Questions that involve objects or entities in a hierarchical relationship or implicit comparisons can lead to misunderstandings. For examples, Theo has to manage his spending in order relative to his trip expenses, or Mark's beanstalk's growth compared with his window's height."
6,Complex Accounting and Tracking,"Questions involving complex accounting, such as multiple transactions, or intricate tracking of objects or entities through multiple step, like baking and eating cookies, often result in errors as they have various points where missteps or miscalculations can occur."
7,Multi-step Calculations and Conversions,Questions that require multiple calculation steps or units conversion (like in repaving a street or the talent show juggling act) may yield incorrect answers if the model fails to correctly sequence calculations or properly convert units.
8,Understanding of Real-world Concepts,"The model also needs to understand real-world concepts to answer accurately. For example, the phone plan costs or the road trips to parents each involve real-world concepts (e.g., a main phone plan costing more or round-trip travel) which the model may not fully comprehend. 

Arraying these failure modes can pave the way for a more precise diagnostic focus and finally, model improvements."
9,Arithmetic Inequities,"AI can fail to understand the proportional relationships between different quantities and how they affect each other in a numerical problem. Problems that involve ratios, fractions, or percentages often pose a challenge. Example questions in this category include ""Maggie spent a quarter of her money, while Riza spent one-third of her money. They each had $60. How much money do the two of them have left?"", or ""Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, how many kilowatts of electric energy will he save in 30 days?"""
10,Variable Mapping & Relationship Understanding,"The model needs to correctly map variables to their appropriate entities and also understand the relationships between these variables. This requires a solid grasp of semantics, as well as the nature of abstract and concrete relationships. For example, 'Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes....' requires the model to understand the relationship between the different time units and the number of reports."
11,Simultaneous Equations & Relation Solving,"Some queries present information that forms a system of equations, where the relationship between multiple quantities needs to be sorted out simultaneously to resolve the question. An example of this is 'Dominick went to his team's changing room and saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs....'."
12,Interpretation of Text Rephrasal,"The model may struggle with questions where information is presented in an unusual or indirect way. For instance, in the question 'A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish...'. The large and small qualifier for jellyfish being a crucial point in the question poses such a failure mode."
13,Non-Linear Dependencies and Conditional Relationships,"Non-linear dependencies and conditional relationships often trip up the model, for example, ""A company pays each of its employees $600 in a month... If Sylvie just clocked 5 years... what's her annual salary after three more years of service?"" involves a geometric progression."
