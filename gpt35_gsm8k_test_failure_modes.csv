Index,Failure Mode,Description
1,Complexity of Time and Numerical Calculation,"Questions that require multiple steps or stages of calculation might lead to errors in the AI's responses. Some of these calculations may take into account time, rate, speed, and percentage, or involve a mixture of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, the question ""John visits his parents twice a month. It takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph. Considering the round trip, how many miles a month does he drive when visiting his parents?"" involves multiple steps of calculation and the concept of distance equals speed times time. Similarly complex are questions that revolve around earnings, profits, and losses or questions that involve fractional changes in quantities. The AI might struggle with these because of the inherent complexity of the time and numerical calculations."
2,Manipulation of Temporal Variables,"The AI might encounter errors while dealing with questions that revolve around manipulating time. These could be forward or backward time calculations, especially when they are intertwined with other numerical calculations. An example question might be ""Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liamâ€™s age was twice the age of Vince. How old is Vince now?"" This question not only requires a deft handling of numerical operations but also an understanding of how time variables work."
3,Compound Reasoning and Assumption Making,"Some questions require the AI to make assumptions on the basis of available information and then use these assumptions to solve the problem at hand. A good example of this is ""A dance studio offers lessons to students. It costs $25 per session to rent the studio plus $1.50 per student per session. At present, the dance studio has 10 students and is rented 3 days a week. How much are the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month?"" The AI must make assumptions about how many weeks are in a month, how each session maps to a day, and generally apply multiple steps of reasoning to find the solution."
4,Implicit Information and Indirect Relationships,"Another common failing in AI's responses comes in handling questions with implicit information or indirect relationships. These often involve a degree of hierarchical or parent-child relationships and calculations may not be directly laid out. For instance, consider ""Abraham owns 80 square meters of unused land. He sold half of the land for $50, and after a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. How much money will he be able to earn after selling all his unused land?"" The AI has to understand and deal with the evolving fractions of land involved."
5,"Percentages, Probabilities, and Ratios","Questions requiring a solid grasp and application of percentages, probability, and ratio concepts often trip up AI responses. So questions like, ""James is counting his Pokemon cards. He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. If he loses 8 of the water type and buys 14 grass type, what's the probability (rounded to the nearest integer) that a randomly picked card will be a water type?"" might prove problematic.

These failure modes signal significant complexities in human-like understanding, reasoning, and calculation abilities that might cause inaccuracies in AI's responses."
6,Sequential Problem Solving Failure,"GPT-3.5 typically struggles with questions requiring multiple sequential calculations. Oftentimes, it might solve the first few steps correctly, but then loses track of the process in the later steps, causing the overall answer to be incorrect. An example of this is 'A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map...'. This complex problem requires solving several sequential mathematical steps correctly which the GPT-3.5 model often struggles to maintain consistently."
7,Handling Compound Growth and Division Operations,"Management of questions necessitating complex multiplicative or divisive growth operations can be uncertain. For example, ""Ten stalls have 20 cows each. Mr. Sylas buys 40 cows and divides them equally..."", requires processing both multiplication and evenly distributed division."
