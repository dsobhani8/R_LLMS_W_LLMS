Index,Failure Mode,Description
1,Arithmetic and Sequencing Failure Mode,"GPT-3 sometimes lacks the ability to process mathematical problems and follow sequential operations accurately. For instance, questions like ""calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months?"" or ""How many cookies does he have now?"" involve step-by-step mathematical operations that need to be executed in a specific order to come to the correct answer. The model might fail to evaluate expressions in the proper sequence which can cause wrong results. 
   
2. **Assumption and Interpretation Failure Mode**: Sometimes GPT-3 fails to pick up on specific assumptions and clues given in the question. For example, in the question ""Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis..."", there's an implicit hint that Seth starts with a certain quantity of stickers. If GPT-3 fails to identify and process such implicit assumptions, it's likely to arrive at an incorrect answer."
2,Investigation Failure Mode,"In questions like ""how many total fruits can an avocado tree produce during its 10 years of life?"", the model has to investigate and infer information across multiple sentences. If GPT-3 can't track and process this information accurately, it tends to produce incorrect answers."
3,Percentage Calculation Failure Mode,"GPT-3 struggles with problems involving the calculation of percentages or probabilities, such as in the question ""What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?"" If it misunderstands the question or incorrectly calculates the chance, it may give incorrect answers."
4,Inadequate Handling of Conditional Statements Failure Mode,"GPT-3 sometimes fails to properly process conditional statements. For example, in the question ""If Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence between them..."", it might not properly consider the condition and end up providing the wrong answer."
5,Fraction Operations Failure Mode,"Questions involving fraction operations can be challenging for GPT-3. For example, in the question ""...how many pints of gasoline did she need?..."" the correct interpretation requires dividing gallons into pints, which the model may not correctly perform, leading to incorrect results."
6,Temporal Relationship Failure Mode,"When complex timeframes are given in the question, GPT-3 sometimes fails to interpret these correctly, as seen in the question, ""...He starts off practicing juggling 3 balls, and slowly gets better adding 1 ball..."", where the model may have a difficult time correlating actions and their relative timeline. 

These failure modes are not mutually exclusive and sometimes overlap within a given question. Despite these limitations, GPT-3 has shown remarkable proficiency in a wide range of tasks but these identified failure modes provide areas for further improvements and testing."
7,Ambiguous Language Processing,"The AI sometimes struggles with ambiguous language or questions that are not entirely clear. This may lead to erroneous assumptions or misinterpretations. For example, in the question ""Andy works in the pro shop of a tennis resort. He has 12 racquets that need restringing."", The duration of the restringing process is not provided in the question."
8,Imprecise Processing of Relative Quantities,"Some questions lack precise numeric information but are written in a way that implies relative quantities. If the model fails to correctly infer these relative quantities, it can lead to erroneous answers. For example, in the question ""A stickler for health, Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. By contract, Octavia’s husband Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee she drinks. Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups."""
9,Currency and Commodity Exchange Confusion,"Questions like ""The caretaker of the docks needs to buy some new line..."" and ""Ralph has a record store where people can trade their old records for new ones..."" involve exchange operations in terms of commodities or currencies. Misunderstanding the exchange rates or quantities can lead the model to provide incorrect answers. Improvements in understanding these real-world exchange operations could positively impact the AI model's ability to answer such queries."
