,Index,Failure Mode,Description
0,1,Inaccuracy in Multi-Step Arithmetic Operations," The model displays recurrent problems with complex arithmetic operations that involve multiple steps of computation. This is exemplified in questions that require the AI to add, subtract, multiply or divide several figures in a sequence to reach an accurate conclusion."
1,2,Inability to Retain Information Over Long Passages," Questions with lengthy prompts pose problems to the model. These prompts contain many details, thus requiring high information retention capacity. The model seems to struggle with holding all these details in mind to deduce an answer correctly."
2,3,Inefficiency in Grasping Time-based Problems, The model has difficulty in handling problem statements dealing with complex time schedules or time-based calculations. Questions that require the model to understand the sequence of events and measure durations between them prove difficult for it to comprehend and solve accurately.
3,4,Inability to Handle Conditional Probability Problems, The model struggles with problem statements that require understanding of conditional probability concepts. This is observed in questions that require determination of probability based on a sequence of dependent events.
4,5,Struggling with Fractions and Percentages," The model also finds it challenging to work with fractions, ratios, and percentages. This is especially visible in questions where conversion between these types of quantities is expected."
5,6,Difficulty with Problems Involving Distributions," The model has issues with understanding and calculating distributions. This manifests in questions where resources are distributed among a certain number of entities following particular rules or ratios, or in problems asking to calculate per unit cost or allocation."
6,7,Understanding Aging and Time Passage, The model has a clear problem understanding the concept of aging and time passage. This specific issue shows itself in problems which require calculation that includes increase of age over time.
7,8,Issues with Comparisons and Relational Logic," The AI model struggles with drawing comparisons or understanding relational logic, e.g., greater than, less than, as many as, half as long as etc. This shows particularly in problems which necessitate comparative logic to derive the correct answer."
8,9,Struggle with Quantifying Abstract Notions," The model finds it challenging to handle questions where it has to quantify abstract ideas or concepts like chance, risk or desperation. These concepts are harder to compute into definite calculations or probabilities."
9,10,Difficulty Handling Spatial Arrangements," The model struggles with problem statements that require it to visualize and understand spatial arrangements. This is observed in questions involving placement of objects in rows, squares, or any particular patterned formation."
